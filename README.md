# To use this extension

0. Clone the repo
  
  `git clone https://github.com/belligerentcow/cyberscholars-scheduling-extension.git`
  
  `cd cyberscholars-scheduling-extension`

1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions. Click “Developer mode” in the top right. Now click “Load unpacked extension…” and select the extension’s directory.
2. Use this extension by clicking on the icon when you are viewing the response-view for a when-is-good poll. As it currently stands, it will spit out the possible combinations of meetings in the javascript console.

P.S. The extension icon is stolen from Google's example extension icon.

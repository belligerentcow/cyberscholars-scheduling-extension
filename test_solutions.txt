The following solutions are in order from worst to best, with explanations for why they get better.

This is a very very bad solution:
{
  possNumSlots: 10,
  1579010400000: [[person1, person2, person3, person4, person5], []]
}

This is better because fewer people in a meeting is better
{
  possNumSlots: 10,
  1579010400000: [[person1], []],
  1578924000000: [[person2], []],
  1578906000000: [[person3], []],
  1579003200000: [[person4], []],
  1578920400000: [[person5], []]
}

However, we also want to minimize the amount of slots we use
{
  possNumSlots: 10,
  1579010400000: [[person1, person2], []],
  1578906000000: [[person3, person4], []],
  1578920400000: [[person5], []]
}

So it's calculus minimization: how can we minimize both the amount of people in slots and the number of slots themselves

There are some other rules too:

Keeping the same schedule on a biweekly basis is better (as a plus in this example, the number of slots is fewer as well)
{
  possNumSlots: 10,
  1579010400000: [[person1, person2], [person3]],
  1578906000000: [[person4], [person5]]
}

Finally, afternoon slots should be favored over morning ones (as a side note, whenisgood.net doesn't
take time zone into account, so all epoch timestamps should be interpreted as GMT, i.e. 1578906000000 is Monday 9am GMT)

{
  possNumSlots: 10,
  1579010400000: [[person1, person2], [person3]],
  1579003200000: [[person4], [person5]]
}

So for five people, if this combination is possible, then this is the ideal form
